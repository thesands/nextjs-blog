          Hello! I'm Dana, a Senior Software Engineer with seven years of
          professional software development experience. I've worked up and down
          the stack and I'm strongest in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular,
          .NET, and Node. At my current job, we are building a new product for
          AT&T that will allow businesses to manage their company phones. My
          role at Globys has also given me a lot of leadership experience as the
          Lead Front-End Engineer. I have trained and mentored several new
          junior, contract, and senior engineers. I have also led various
          projects that required extensive requirement gathering and working
          directly with the customer. My passion as an engineer encourages me to
          speak up for others and help my team deliver top notch code.
